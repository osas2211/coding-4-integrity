    description: "This module builds on the foundations of personal integrity by introducing children to the simple definition of corruption: the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Through engaging animated scenarios and interactive activities, young learners will explore how authority works in their immediate environment—from games and family settings to school and community. Students will learn to recognize who holds positions of trust and power in their daily lives, understand the responsibilities that come with authority, and identify the consequences when that trust is broken. By working through relatable situations like 'The Fair Prize' story, children develop the ethical awareness and courage needed to spot unfairness and take appropriate action to restore justice in their communities.",

    description: "This powerful module teaches children that speaking up when witnessing unfair situations is essential for maintaining integrity and fairness in their community. Young learners discover how to voice concerns about dishonesty safely by identifying trusted adults and understanding proper reporting channels. Through creative digital expression and interactive chatbot simulations, students practice finding the courage and determination needed to report unfair exchanges, embezzlement, or abuse of power. The module emphasizes that their voice matters—when children speak up as 'reporting persons,' they provide valuable insight that helps restore equality and supports the most vulnerable members of society affected by corruption.",
